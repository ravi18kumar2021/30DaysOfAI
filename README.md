# 🚀 30DaysOfAI – Learning Journey with Streamlit

Welcome to my 30-day hands-on Artificial Intelligence learning challenge! In this journey, I learn and implement concepts from **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – and turn them into **interactive Streamlit web apps**. 📊🧠📜

Every day comes with a small learning goal and a deployed web tool to showcase my understanding.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Learn and apply core ML/DL/NLP concepts
- Build small, interactive tools in Streamlit
- Share progress openly with the community
- Create a public portfolio for future reference and learning
